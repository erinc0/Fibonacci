Enter a number into the command line. It will then become the index for the Fibonacci sequence. For instance, "16" will produce 987.
If a non integer is entered, the program will return "(Argument _______) must be an integer."
The Fibonacci formula begins with index 0 = 0, index 1 = 1. The two numbers are added together to form the third index (=2). The second index is added to the third index to form 3 and so on.
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 is the equation.
